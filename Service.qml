// Headless singleton behind the radar plugin.
//
// A bar widget is instantiated once per monitor, so anything that polls has to
// live here instead: the shell mounts exactly one service per plugin, which
// keeps a two-monitor setup from doubling every request.
//
// Two responsibilities:
//
//   1. Own the RainViewer frame manifest, so that a two-monitor setup showing
//      the map on both shares one copy instead of fetching one each. It is 818
//      bytes, and is fetched only while the map is open. The property is
//      `radarManifest` rather than the obvious `manifest` because the shell
//      assigns the plugin's own manifest.json to any service exposing a
//      property by that name.
//
//   2. Decide whether to warn about approaching weather, and say so once.
//
// On (2), a note on why the alert reads a point forecast rather than the radar
// image it draws. Distance alone does not mean approaching — a cell 80 km east
// travelling east is not your problem — so a radar-echo alert would have to
// derive motion vectors across frames to avoid crying wolf. The question the
// user is actually asking is "will weather hit me, and how bad", and a point
// forecast answers exactly that, including the instability indices that
// separate ordinary rain from a severe storm. Radar remains the better picture;
// the forecast is the better trigger.
